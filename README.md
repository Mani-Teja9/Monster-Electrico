⚡ **Project Showcase: Monster Electrio** ⚡

I'm excited to introduce my latest project: **Monster Electrio**! This dynamic web application is built with a strong emphasis on JavaScript, comprising 70% of the project, alongside 20% HTML and 10% CSS.

**Project Highlights:**
- **JavaScript-Driven Functionality:** The core functionality is powered by JavaScript, providing a highly interactive and engaging user experience.
- **Structured HTML:** Utilizes well-organized HTML to create a solid foundation and ensure semantic structure.
- **Minimalist CSS:** Applies efficient CSS to enhance the visual appeal without overwhelming the user interface.

Monster Electrio showcases my ability to create complex and interactive web applications with a primary focus on JavaScript.
